What began as an outcry against a government ban on social media this September soon transformed into something much deeper: a generational revolt.
Nearly two decades after the end of its civil war, Nepal still grapples with questions that should have been answered long ago: Who truly holds power – the people, or the parties that claim to represent them? Nepal has always been a land of contrasts – breathtaking natural beauty set against a backdrop of political uncertainty. For decades, the nation has oscillated between hope and chaos, between dreams of stability and the weight of corruption, bureaucracy, and unfulfilled promises.
In the early September of 2025, Cities across Nepal were set ablaze – not with fire but rage. Rage of those who call themselves “Gen Z”, those who were tired of the growing corruption and restrictions set on them. They came to the streets with slogans, chants, peaceful protests. The reaction was swift, violent, and tragic.
Peace shattered, from what started as peaceful marching unfurled into deadly riots. Security forces used tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons—and ultimately live ammunition—when protesters pushed toward restricted zones, including attempts to breach the Parliament complex. Nineteen lives were lost, most of them students — dreamers of a better Nepal. Their blood stained the streets they had hoped to rebuild.
The government lifted the ban and issued apologies and swore to root out the corruption that had infested it, but for the youth, it was too little, too late. This moment marks something significant – a statement. The youth of Nepal will no longer stand on the sidelines and suffer. The generation that has grown up online, exposed to global ideas has decided not to wait. But it may have come too late. There’s blood on the streets now. Lives lost. Dreams interrupted, and scars that won’t heal overnight.
But the question that echoes through the empty, broken streets is one asked far too many time in
Nepal’s history. A nation betrayed by its leaders time and time again and too often saved by its people.
<strong>Will Nepal rise from the ashes — or be the spark that sets the political world aflame?</strong></p>
